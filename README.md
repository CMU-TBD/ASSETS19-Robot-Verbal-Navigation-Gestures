This repository contains the code for running the Exploration II described in the ASSETS 2019 Paper: "Go That Way: Exploring Supplementary Physical Movements by a Stationary Robot When Providing Navigation Instructions" By Xiang Zhi Tan, Elizabeth J. Carter, Samantha Reig and Aaron Steinfeld.

This repo serves as a checkpoint of the code used in the study and also proof-of-concept for those who wish to build upon it. This is not a working or production version of the code. The code also contains large number of dependencies on other project.
